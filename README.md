## About the project

The project is a weather forecast website created using JavaScript, compiled using webpack and uses three Openweathermap's APIs: Current Weather Data API, Geocoding API, and One Call API. Additional features as time goes on may be added.
<br/><br/>

## Features:

- Automatically displays a random background image before searching any location.
- App changes the background photo depending on type of weather and on time of day.
- Geocoding API was used to retrieve specific coordinates to be submitted to the One Call API for maximum accuracy.
- The unit of measurement can be changed manually.
